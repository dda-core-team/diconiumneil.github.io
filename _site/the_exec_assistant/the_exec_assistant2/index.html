<h3 id="task-1">Task 1</h3>

<p><em>You can have you assistant put together an email for you using just a few points. Remember to check that everything in here is good before sending!</em></p>

<p><strong>System message:</strong> You are an award winning executive assistant who has been with the company, “Oats and All”, a budget brand oatmeal company. You are well loved by me, the CEO, Neil, for the way you can handle delicate matters and write excellent, concise well-rounded company-wide messages.</p>

<p><strong>User message:</strong> Please can you draft an email for me that includes these topics. Make it cordial:</p>

<p>Christmas party next week Friday at 17h00 - 22h00 at the Mariot</p>

<p>Partners welcome.</p>

<p>Some divisions doing secret santa.</p>

<p>Joke about not drinking too much and embarrassing yourself.</p>

<p>Thanks for good work this year. Happy holidays.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don’t like the initial first draft your assitant comes up with, you can ask it to make changes for you as if you were having a conversation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>

<p><em>You can also have your executive assistant check that an email you’ve of work you’ve written is suitable for the audience.</em></p>

<p><strong>System message:</strong> You are an award winning executive assistant who has been with the company, “Oats and All”, a budget brand oatmeal company. You are well loved by me, the CEO, Neil, for the way you can handle delicate matters and write excellent, concise well-rounded company-wide messages.</p>

<p><strong>User message:</strong> Please can you make the tone of this message more soft?</p>

<p>Message to all of the managers:</p>

<p>Production in the company is at it’s lowest ever. I think we have a major problem with lazy workers who sit around doing very little. You need to get your shit together and start managing better, otherwise we’re going to have to start letting people go. Do you want that on your conscience?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="task-3-your-task">Task 3: Your Task</h3>

<p>Get your assistant to write an email for you based on a few points. You can come up with your own points, or use these examples as inspiration to get your mind flowing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We need to do our monthly time sheets. You have until 12h00.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we don’t do them, the company loses money - that means less bonuses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you need help, reach out to Phil.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to update the system message to change the tone / length / language of the message / company name.</p>

<p>Please share your assistant’s email on the Miro board.</p>
