<p>US – Low financial stress means a recession remains unlikely</p>

<p>Sygnia		By Nikita Hadskins</p>

<p>Portfolio Manager</p>

<p>Global uncertainty continues to rise, and a bar of gold is now worth more than one million dollars for the first time. On the US political front, incumbent President Joe Biden appealed for support for Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama updated his own campaign slogan to “Yes, she can.” Harris has unveiled her economic policies and will increase the US corporate tax rate to 28% if she wins the White House in November. While this is positive for the staggering US debt pile, it is unfavourable for US companies – but is still below the 35% tax rate that was in place before the tax reduction policies Donald Trump introduced in his first term. Harris’s policies are generally perceived as less favourable to equities due to higher taxes and regulation. Harris and Trump are presently too close to call, so the presidential debate on 10 September should be insightful.</p>

<p>Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee Jerome Powell confirmed the September rate cut in his Jackson Hole symposium speech. His speech was dovish relative to the July minutes, stating variously that “conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic”, that it is “unlikely that the labour market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures” and that the Fed “do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions.” Headline and core CPI eased for the fourth consecutive month in July. The three-month moving average continued to improve, reaching a three-and-a-half-year low. Unfortunately, “supercore” inflation (core services ex-shelter) reaccelerated in July, and shelter inflation grew 0.4% month-on-month from 0.2% in June. We thus remain in the higher-for-longer camp on the US. Growth is slowing to trend, but financial stress is often the cause of recessions – and financial stress in the US has been easing this year (based on the Kansas Fed Financial Stress Index).</p>
