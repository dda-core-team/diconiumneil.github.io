<p><em>Just like a human who plans step-by-step, we can get better performance from our language model is we get it to think through what it’s doing step by step. This method is called “Chain of Thought”</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>System message:</strong> [Leave Blank]</p>

<p>Below you will find a set of feedback from different employees from our company:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ve never had such a good work-life balance before. The leadership team genuinely listens to feedback, and we have a clear roadmap ahead. Plus, the office environment is really vibrant.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.Communication here is a mess. It feels like we’re always reinventing the wheel because no one documents anything properly. Also, I’m pretty sure the air conditioning is broken in half the building.</p>

<p>3.I feel like I’m doing meaningful work, but the team can be hit or miss. Some projects are exciting, but others are tedious and drag on forever. At least the benefits are decent.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The team atmosphere is incredible—everyone is supportive and collaborative. I also appreciate the flexible working hours; they make juggling personal and professional life so much easier. I actually look forward to Mondays!</li>
</ol>

<p>5.Management never seems to have a clear direction, and priorities change every other week. It’s hard to get anything done with such constant chaos. Honestly, I’m not sure how long I can keep doing this.</p>

<p>6.The perks are nice, like the gym membership and free snacks, but the work itself can be pretty monotonous. It’s not bad, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about what I do here. It’s a job, nothing more.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ve grown so much since I started working here! My manager actively mentors me, and I’m given challenging projects that push me to improve. The company culture is just really positive overall.</li>
</ol>

<p>8.It feels like a lot of favoritism goes on in promotions. You could be doing great work but get overlooked if you’re not in the “right” crowd. Morale has really dipped because of that.</p>

<p>9.Some days are good, some not so much. It all depends on which project I’m working on and who’s leading it. But hey, the Friday afternoon beer hour is something to look forward to.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I love how transparent the leadership is about the company’s goals and challenges. We’re constantly encouraged to innovate, and I feel like my ideas are genuinely valued. It’s been a fantastic experience so far.</li>
</ol>

<p>11.There’s zero room for growth here. I’ve been doing the same tasks over and over again with no recognition or opportunities to develop new skills. The monotony is killing me.</p>

<p>12.The work itself is fine, but the pace is really slow. I don’t feel particularly challenged, but it’s steady and predictable, which I guess isn’t the worst thing. Still, it’d be nice to feel excited about something once in a while.</p>

<ol>
  <li>This place is super dynamic, and I feel like I’m always learning something new. I love being part of such a fast-paced environment where creativity is encouraged. Plus, the leadership is top-notch.</li>
</ol>

<p>14.It’s hard to get motivated when there’s no real recognition or appreciation for the work we do. Everyone seems to be here just to collect a paycheck. The atmosphere is pretty depressing, to be honest.</p>

<p>15.The company’s okay, but nothing to write home about. It pays the bills, but I don’t feel like I’m making a huge impact. It’s stable, I guess, and that counts for something in this economy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The leadership here really cares about employees’ well-being. They’ve gone above and beyond to support us during tough times, and I genuinely feel valued. I couldn’t ask for a better work environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>17.The micromanagement here is unbearable. I can’t make any decisions without going through five layers of approval. It’s suffocating and makes it impossible to be productive.</p>

<p>18.I’ve had some great learning opportunities, but at the same time, the workload is so inconsistent. Some weeks are a grind, while others feel like I’m just sitting around waiting for something to do.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The autonomy we’re given here is fantastic. I feel trusted to make decisions and really own my work. The company culture is also incredibly supportive—everyone’s got each other’s back.</li>
</ol>

<p>20.I’ve never worked in a place with such poor communication between departments. It’s like we’re all on different planets, and nothing ever gets done efficiently. I’m seriously considering my options elsewhere.</p>

<p>I want you to help me to come up with a strategy to improve employee mood at the company. I want you to think through this step by step, first summarising the insights from these employee reports and then coming up with a strategy.</p>
