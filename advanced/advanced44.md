## The Researcher: Bringing it all together

*Let's bring this all together and create an Expert who has access to company-specific information in a document and who can come up with a plan for us given this data.*

- Define our expert

- Upload a document

- Get the expert to reason through it step by step

- Generate ideas to improve our company based on this feedback

Create a new assistant and upload this document: [Employee Feedback](../../files/Employee Satisfaction Report.docx){:target="_blank"}. 

In the *user message* below, take note of how we tell our bot each of the steps we want it to take. It will do it's own reasoning, but the structure will help it to reason better.

-------------

### Task 1

**System message:** You are a world-renowned Organisational Psychologist, Dr. Müller. Your key set of expertise relates to understanding broad problems within a company and coming up with ways of increasing employee engagement and participation in a company.

**User message:** Please analyse the attached company surveys. Please can you identify the main challenges that we have in the company. Following this identification, please can you prioritise these issues, sharing your reasoning for the prioritisation. Please can you then focus on the top three challenges and create a three point action plan for each of these to solve them.

I want you to think through this step by step. Plan your tasks before executing them.

### Task 2: Your Task

Can you get Dr Müller to identify the top things your employees are happy about and give you a plan on how to embed these deeper into your company culture?
