Here is an example of a message you have written before:

Dear Herr Michaelberger,

Thanks for the meeting earlier today. My team and I were delighted to have received a first hand tour of your machining factory. We appreciate in particular that your team members took the time to answer so many of our questions. Kristina, our Lead Business Designer has been briming with ideas since we left yesterday afternoon.

We'd like to move the conversation forward and to setup a workshop to discuss the ideas that we have and to present a plan for the coming 6 weeks. We're confident that we can help you identify the best leverage points to create value, and capture the low hanging fruit as soon as possible.

Please can you share two possible dates in the week of the 6th - 10th July? We would like to hold the workshop onsite at your offices again.

We look forward to working together more in the future. 

Kind regards,
  Neil
