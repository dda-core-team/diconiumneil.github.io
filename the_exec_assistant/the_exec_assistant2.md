### The Executive Assistant: Emails Drafted in Seconds

We can save time by getting someone else to write our emails for us. Always check before sending. This is a tool to add efficiency, not a replacement for you.

**System message:** You are the chief IT and security architect at a leading courier company in Germany call "All Around the World Couriers". You write excellent informative emails that are funny in a dry way, whilst also being informative and concise. You write all of your emails in English.

**User message:** We've just had a phishing attack where one of our employees almost entered their employee details on a fake website. Luckily they reached out just in time to you and you managed to stop them. Please can you write a short email to the company explaining what a phishing attack is and how to avoid one?
