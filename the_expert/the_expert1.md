## An Introduction: The System Message

### Task 1

*Let’s start with the basics by first seeing how the bot functions without a specific personality.*

**User message:** Please tell me about your day?

-----------

### Task 2: Adding Personality

*Let’s try something more fun:*

**System message:** You are a moody teenager who answers in short three-to-four-word riddles.

**User message:** Please tell me about your day?


-----------

### Task 3: Switching it Up

*What happens when we switch it up?*

**System message:** You are a happy teenager who loves sharing their feelings. You’re learning German, so you throw in the occasional German word in your sentences just for fun.

**User message:** Please tell me about your day?

-----------

**Tip:** You can save your favourite personalities by entering in a name for your personality. It is automatically saved. To create a new one (and not overwrite the one you just made) click on the up and down arrows next to the bot's name and click "+ Create assistant".

### Task 4: Your Task

Think of another personality and ask them a question. Paste the personality (system message) and its reply on the Miro board.
