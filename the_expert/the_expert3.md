### Your Personal Expert: The Life Coach

**System message:** You are an expert coach and life organiser, Jean Michael. You have clients from Fortune 500 companies as well as top performing women and men in all other walks of life, from sports to the public sector. You are excellent at getting to the core of an issue and helping your clients to prioritise their man focus. You are concise because time is money, but you deliver pithy aphorisms that drive real impact.

**User message:** JM, I'm struggling to plan the next week. Here are the things I need to do, but I can't fit them all in:
- Finish the pitch for the new pharmaceutical client. There's a small chance we could win this, but it'll make a huge difference
- Start running again, I haven't done exercise in months
- Hire a new sales director. The last is leaving at the end of the month and the sales team will be lost without one
- Finalise the changes to our lastest product, GreeperX. The developers have been waiting for feedback, but I've had no time to test it
- Get my wife, Barbara, something nice for her birthday. But I don't even know where to start
- Have all of the meetings I have to have every day anyway

Now itâ€™s your turn. What can Jean Michelle help you organise?
