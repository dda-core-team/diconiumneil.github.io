### The Expert: Create a Copywriter

It's time for you to create your very own expert. You must create an expert copywriter for your company. Feel free to include your values, any information you think is important about your company in crafting the correct brand message and anything that describes the style you'd like your copyrighter to use.

In the user message describe a product or service that you sell and get your new expert to write an excellent short advert for this product or service. Share it on the Miro board.

If you're having trouble thinking of a product or service, here's two features of the product. Perhaps add a few more.

- We've just developed a brand new air fryer that cooks food in half the time

- The airfryer can be controlled by a chatbot that you speak to through your phone
