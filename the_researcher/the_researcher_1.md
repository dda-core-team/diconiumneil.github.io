Below is an email which I recieved from an investment company. Please can you give me a summary of the main points in bullet form:

Carry trade flash crash
Sygnia		By Kyle Hulett
Co-Head: Investments
August was a roller coaster month, but financial asset prices recovered after early August’s massive flash crash, when Japanese equities fell 20%. The cause was two sides of the same coin, with each representing a leg of the carry trade that in combination resulted in pronounced moves. One side was near-zero yields in Japan, which made incredibly cheap funding available for investors to borrow, with the weakened yen making that funding profitable. The other leg of the carry trade, buying US technology stocks, was also profitable. However, geared trades like this are very sensitive to volatility, and the volatility spike in this instance forced further sales. The unwind trigger comprised two separate events. The ever-weakening yen bubble popped in August after a surprise Bank of Japan (BOJ) interest rate hike to 0.25% and after Japan intervened in currency markets, causing the yen to appreciate aggressively. And in the US, one weaker-than-anticipated employment report lifted the odds of a US recession significantly, but that report was distorted by Hurricane Beryl. According to Goldman Sachs, systematic funds (which buy stocks based on market signals and volatility) sold their largest dollar volume of equities in four years in August.


Markets calmed after the BOJ’s Deputy Governor said it would not raise policy rates again amid market instability, and better-than-expected data from the US calmed fears of a US recession. The S&P Global US Composite PMI and the Atlanta Fed’s GDP Nowcast model both suggest that economic activity is resilient. US retail sales also surprised to the upside in July. The CBOE Volatility Index fell as markets calmed, and systematic funds are expected to buy stocks again – but shifting the funder from the yen to the dollar or yuan. With ever-increasing levels of financial debt, however, gearing remains a risk to market stability.

US – Low financial stress means a recession remains unlikely
Sygnia		By Nikita Hadskins
Portfolio Manager
Global uncertainty continues to rise, and a bar of gold is now worth more than one million dollars for the first time. On the US political front, incumbent President Joe Biden appealed for support for Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama updated his own campaign slogan to “Yes, she can.” Harris has unveiled her economic policies and will increase the US corporate tax rate to 28% if she wins the White House in November. While this is positive for the staggering US debt pile, it is unfavourable for US companies – but is still below the 35% tax rate that was in place before the tax reduction policies Donald Trump introduced in his first term. Harris’s policies are generally perceived as less favourable to equities due to higher taxes and regulation. Harris and Trump are presently too close to call, so the presidential debate on 10 September should be insightful.


Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee Jerome Powell confirmed the September rate cut in his Jackson Hole symposium speech. His speech was dovish relative to the July minutes, stating variously that “conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic”, that it is “unlikely that the labour market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures” and that the Fed “do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions.” Headline and core CPI eased for the fourth consecutive month in July. The three-month moving average continued to improve, reaching a three-and-a-half-year low. Unfortunately, “supercore” inflation (core services ex-shelter) reaccelerated in July, and shelter inflation grew 0.4% month-on-month from 0.2% in June. We thus remain in the higher-for-longer camp on the US. Growth is slowing to trend, but financial stress is often the cause of recessions – and financial stress in the US has been easing this year (based on the Kansas Fed Financial Stress Index).
