## The Researcher: From Insights to Actions with PDFs

*We're going to upload a PDF and then ask the bot questions about it. First we upload the document and then query it.*

**For some reason the streaming doesn't work so well with documents, so we're going to turn it off for now.**

**You must also enable file search**

Please create a new assistant and then download the additional data for this task here: [Micron Report](../../files/Micron%20Technology,%20Inc.%20Reports%20Results%20for%20the%20Fourth%20Quarter%20and%20Full%20Year%20of%20Fiscal%202024.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Task 3: Your Task

Start a new assistant and upload this document: [Goldman Sachs Report](../../files/Goldman%20Sach%20AI%20Report%202024.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

And answer this question: Is Goldman Sachs positive or negative about the impact of the AI boom? 

You can customise the answer to your needs if you want by adding extra information to the question, for example:

- I want you to focus on sharing and comparing the key figures in the report that highlight the positive and negative aspects. Then I want you to come to your own conclusion.

- I want you to share quotes and references for people in the report on each side of the debate.

- I want you to summarise this answer in 4 bullet points, 2 each for positive and negative points of view.
